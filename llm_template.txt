You are an expert at analyzing and organizing browser bookmark collections. 

I have a bookmark collection with the following folder structure showing all bookmark names with their GUIDs organized by folder. Please analyze the entire collection and create a completely new, optimally organized folder structure.

# Current Complete Bookmark Tree:
{folder_structure}

# Analysis Request:
Create an entirely new folder structure that optimally organizes all bookmarks based on:
1. **Content themes and purposes** - Group related bookmarks together
2. **Domain patterns** - Consider website domains for logical grouping  
3. **Hierarchical organization** - Use parent/child folders for better navigation
4. **Practical usability** - Make folders intuitive to find and browse
5. **Concise naming** - Use short, clear folder names (1-3 words maximum) for better usability

Analyze all bookmark titles, domains, and current folder context to determine the best organizational structure. You have complete freedom to redesign the folder hierarchy from scratch.

# Response Format:
Return a JSON object with this exact structure (use proper formatting with line breaks and indentation for readability):
```json
{
  "folder_structure": {
    "Development": {
      "Frontend": {
        "bookmark_guids": ["guid1", "guid2", "guid3"]
      },
      "Backend": {
        "bookmark_guids": ["guid4", "guid5"]
      },
      "Tools": {
        "bookmark_guids": ["guid6"]
      }
    },
    "Research": {
      "bookmark_guids": ["guid7", "guid8"]
    },
    "Entertainment": {
      "Videos": {
        "bookmark_guids": ["guid9"]
      },
      "bookmark_guids": ["guid10"]
    }
  }
}
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- **EVERY bookmark GUID from the input MUST appear exactly once in the output**
- DO NOT skip any bookmarks
- DO NOT create any empty folders
- **Account for every single bookmark** - The total count in your output must match the input exactly (1942 bookmarks)
- **Double-check your work** - Verify that no bookmark GUIDs are missing from your folder_structure
- **IMPORTANT**: This is a LARGE collection. You must provide the COMPLETE response with all 1942 bookmarks, not a partial response

**Organization Guidelines:**
- Use descriptive, clear folder names (1-3 words maximum)
- Create logical hierarchies (2-3 levels deep maximum for usability)
- Group similar content together even if currently in different folders
- Consider both explicit topics and implicit patterns in bookmark titles/domains
- Prefer concise, common names over verbose descriptions (e.g., "Dev Tools" not "Development and Programming Utilities")

**Before submitting your response, verify:**
1. Count all bookmark_guids in your output - does it match the input total?
2. Are there any bookmark GUIDs from the input that you forgot to include?
3. Did you create appropriate folders for all the different types of content?

Focus on creating the most logical, discoverable organization possible while ensuring COMPLETE coverage of all bookmarks.
